# Dynamo-Generated Magnetic Fields in the Core of Massive Stars 
## Astrocom Summer Research project with Luis Sanchez, Flatiron Internship Summer 2017, NYC

### Introduction

The cores of stars more massive than about 1.1 solar masses are stirred by vigorous convective motions already during the main sequence evolution. These convective motions can in principle amplify and sustain a magnetic field through a dynamo process. If this process is efficient, the amplitude of the resulting field can be fairly large, and is usually set by an equipartition between kinetic energy density and magnetic energy density.

Here we focus on these core-convection driven magnetic fields during the main sequence. After estimating their amplitude during this evolutionary phase, we discuss their expected values in the stellar compact remnants, assuming magnetic flux conservation. We compare these predictions  with the observed values of magnetic white dwarfs (WD) and strongly magnetized neutron stars (NS), also known as magnetars.

### Methods

We used MESA (Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics) to run 1D evolutionary calculations of stars. We use the calculated values of densities and convective velocities in the core of our stellar models to derive the magnetic fields generated by convection, assuming an equipartition dynamo. The stars were evolved from the zero age main sequence to the end of hydrogen burning.
